# Create-Account
A Create Account / Sign Up form validation 👤

# About this project 🚀
I have built a form validation using HTML, CSS and  JavaScript. The Form has a pleasing design and has cool animations. If none of the inputs are filled in, the border will turn red, to symbolize that the user have to fill in the inputs. If the user clicks on the eye symbol (next to the password input), the password will automaticly show whats in the field (shown as a text).
